Suggestions:

1.Cancellation rates rises as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work
   on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on location. They can also provide 
   some discounts to the consumers.

2.As the ratio of cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city
   hotels. So the hotels should provide a resonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.

3.In the month of January, hotels can start campains or marketing with a resonable amount to increase their 
   revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.

4.They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation
